# Culvert Analysis Toolkit

*NOTE: this repository is work-in-progress* 

The Culvert Analysis Toolkit is an Inlet + Culvert Peak-Flow and Capacity Calculator that runs in ArcGIS Pro and uses a TR-55 Model and parameters derived from geospatial data.

This software encompasses work originally developed by the Cornell Soil & Water Lab (on GitHub @ [github.com/SoilWaterLab](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab))

## Installation and Use

This repository represents an evolution of a previous effort, the [Peak-Flow Calculator](https://github.com/civicmapper/peak-flow-calculator/), which was a hard fork of the Water Lab's [CulvertEvalution](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/CulvertEvaluation) repository. 

Made in collaboration with the Cornell S&W lab, this repository includes additional updates to the science of the analysis from [CulvertModel_2.1](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/CulvertModel_2.1), as well as a ground-up rebuild of the supporting codebase.

* Original peak flow analytics are based on the culvert evaluation model developed by Rebecca Marjerison at the Cornell Soil and Water Lab in 2013, as [CulvertEvalution](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/CulvertEvaluation)
* David Gold, python script development, August 4, 2015
* Object-oriented structure and resiliency updates built by Noah Warnke, August 31 2016 (no formulas changed).
