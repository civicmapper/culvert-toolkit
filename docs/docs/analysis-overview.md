# Overview

*Using the tools; best practices for working with large datasets and basins*

## Model Input Consideration

Balancing DEM hydrologic and NAACC location-correctedness

* Full hydrologic correction of the DEM and re-locating of culverts with LIDAR and imagery
* snap culverts to available hydro steam lines, burn the lines into the DEMs

Depends on the use case!

### NAACC culvert data accuracy (spatial and temporal)

...

### Hydrologically-corrected Digital Elevation Models (DEMs)
