# Culvert Analysis Toolkit

***This documentation is a work-in-progress***

The Culvert Analysis Toolkit is an Inlet + Culvert Peak-Flow and Capacity Calculator that uses a TR-55 Model and parameters derived from geospatial data.

* See [Installation](installation.md) to get the Culvert Analysis Toolkit running in ArcGIS Pro
* [The toolbox](agp-python-toolbox.md) page provides an overview of the toolbox.
* See the [Data Guides overview](data-overview.md) to understand the types inputs the tool requires
* The [Analysis Guide overview](analysis-guide-overview.md) describes the ways the tool can be run.

This software encompasses work originally developed by the Cornell Soil & Water Lab (on GitHub @ [github.com/SoilWaterLab](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab))

This repository represents an evolution of a previous effort, the [Peak-Flow Calculator](https://github.com/civicmapper/peak-flow-calculator/), which was a hard fork of the Water Lab's [CulvertEvalution](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/CulvertEvaluation) repository. 

Made in collaboration with the Cornell S&W lab, this repository includes additional updates to the science of the from [CulvertModel_2.1](https://github.com/SoilWaterLab/CulvertModel_2.1).
