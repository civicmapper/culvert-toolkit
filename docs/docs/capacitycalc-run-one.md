1. Create (or get) Digital Elevation Model-derived rasters: flow direction, slope, and (optionally) flow length: [Digital Elevation Model-derived Data](data-dem.md)
1. Download rainfall data from NOAA: [Getting NOAA Rainfall Data](data-noaa-rainfall.md)
1. Create (or get) a Curve Number raster: [Generating a Curve Number Raster](data-curve-number-raster.md)
